To install R 4.0.2 simply use the following commmands:

$ chmod u+x INSTALL
$ ./INSTALL /absolute/path/to/desired/dir

Make sure that you specify which directory you want to
install under. If you don't you will run into a lot
of permissions issues.

One thing that this script will do is detect if
you already have an installation of R in your current
directory. If it notices that there is a prior install
of R then it will name the installation directory
"R-4.0.2"

This script will also create a module file that you will
use in order to use R 4.0.2. This feature can be overided
by modifying the .bashrc file, but a module is more conducive
to how users interact with the system.

If you run into any issues or have any questions about this 
installer then please contact Jason at iask@ics.psu.edu
