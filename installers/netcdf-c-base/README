To install the base configuration of netCDF simply use the following commands:

$ chmod u+x INSTALL
$ ./INSTALL /absolute/path/to/desired/dir

Warning:
    Make sure that you use an absolute path or
    the installer may install netCDF incorrectly.
    Also, make sure you are installing netCDF in a
    directory where you have permission to. If you
    don't, you will run into issues with permissions.

This script will detect if you have prior installation
of the base netCDF. If it finds it, then it will install
netCDF under "netcdf-4.7.4"

Another thing that this script will do is create a netCDF
module file that you can use. If you don't want to use the
module file then you can modify the .bashrc file, but the
module file takes the hassle out of modifying your environment.

If you run into any issues or have any questions about this 
installer then please contact Jason at iask@ics.psu.edu
